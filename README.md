## About Me

IT professional with over six years of experience in enterprise environments, currently transitioning into a specialized Cybersecurity role.

My background includes Senior Service Desk and infrastructure support positions within international organizations, where I worked with network security technologies, identity and access management, cloud platforms and critical incident resolution. This experience strengthened my analytical capabilities, structured incident handling approach and exposure to real-world security challenges in production environments.

To deepen my technical expertise beyond operational IT, I completed a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity, expanding my knowledge across defensive security, risk management, OSINT and offensive methodologies. Through this process, I developed a strong interest in technical security analysis and adversarial thinking.

I am currently focused on:

- Advanced hands-on security labs (Hack The Box, TryHackMe and similar platforms)
- Offensive security learning paths
- OSINT investigation workflows and tooling
- Structured, methodology-driven technical documentation

One of my key academic projects involved designing a custom Linux distribution tailored for OSINT investigations, strengthening my understanding of system architecture, tool integration and investigative environments.

My objective is to transition into a Cybersecurity Analyst role where I can combine operational experience with deeper technical security capabilities, while progressively developing offensive security expertise.

I value structured methodology, technical depth and continuous improvement.
